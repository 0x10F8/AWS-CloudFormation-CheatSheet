The target security group also needs an inbound rule that allows traffic from\n               the source security group. Note that you cannot use the <code class=\"code\">Ref</code> function to\n               specify the outbound and inbound rules for each security group. Doing so creates a\n               circular dependency; you cannot have two resources that depend on each other.\n               Instead, use the egress and ingress resources to declare these outbound and inbound\n               rules, as shown in the following template example.</p>",
