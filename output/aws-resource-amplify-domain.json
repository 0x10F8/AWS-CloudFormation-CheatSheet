This occurs during the creation of a custom domain or when a custom domain is updated to use a custom certificate.

If your custom domain is on Route\u00c2\u00a053, Amplify handles this for you automatically. For more information about custom domains, see Setting up custom domains in the Amplify Hosting User Guide.   UPDATE_COMPLETE  The certificate has been associated with a domain.
