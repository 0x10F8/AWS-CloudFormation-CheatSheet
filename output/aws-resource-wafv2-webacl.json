AWS WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that  are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. AWS WAF calculates  capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple  rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more  processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their  web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500."

The syntax for the label namespace prefix for a web ACL is the following: awswaf:<account ID>:webacl:<web ACL name>:  When a rule with a label matches a web request, AWS WAF adds the fully  qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label is made up of the label namespace  from the rule group or web ACL where the rule is defined and the label from the rule,  separated by a colon."
